    <main style="padding: 1.5rem;">
      <p><strong>Carithm AI</strong> is a free, AI-powered car diagnostic tool designed to help users identify vehicle problems quickly and accurately. You can describe symptoms in plain language or enter OBD-II codes to receive mechanic-level insights—no technical knowledge required.</p>

      <h2>🔧 How It Was Built</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Custom-built symptom and fault code databases</li>
        <li>Condition-based rule matching for common and complex problems</li>
        <li>Natural language mappings for real-world phrasing like “car shakes” or “won’t start”</li>
        <li>Gradio and open-source tools for a fast, responsive interface</li>
        <li>AI integration via Together.ai’s API for context-based suggestions</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The goal is to make car diagnostics less stressful, more reliable, and completely free—by putting the power of AI in the hands of everyday drivers.</p>
