    <h1>Things to Check Before Buying a Used Car</h1>

    <p>Buying a used car can be a smart decision—especially with today’s prices. But it can also turn into a costly mistake if you’re not careful. Whether you're buying from a dealership or a private seller, here's a practical, no-fluff checklist to follow before sealing the deal.</p>

    <p>For fast help diagnosing used car issues, you can always try <a href="https://fix-my-car-ai.vercel.app/" target="_blank">Carithm, the AI car mechanic</a>.</p>

    <h2>1. Vehicle History Report</h2>
    <img src="car1.jpg" alt="Engine Misfire" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin: 10px 0;" />
    <p>Always start by requesting a <strong>vehicle history report</strong>. Services like Carfax or AutoCheck reveal if the car has been in major accidents, floods, had odometer rollbacks, or was used as a rental or taxi. Never skip this step—it’s your first line of defense.</p>

    <h2>2. Inspect for Rust or Body Damage</h2>
    <p>Walk around the car and look closely for rust, mismatched paint, or signs of previous repairs. Small scratches are okay, but large areas of rust or bent panels may indicate deeper damage. Use a flashlight to look under wheel wells and underbody panels.</p>

    <h2>3. Check the Tires</h2>
    <img src="car2.jpg" alt="Engine Misfire" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin: 10px 0;" />
    <p>Uneven tire wear could signal suspension or alignment issues. Tires should wear evenly across the tread and have at least 4/32” tread left. Replacing four tires right after buying a car is an expense you want to avoid.</p>

    <h2>4. Examine the Engine Bay</h2>
    <p>Open the hood. Look for oil leaks, cracked belts, or corroded battery terminals. If the engine bay is spotless, that’s not always good—it might be cleaned to hide leaks. Consider using <a href="https://fix-my-car-ai.vercel.app/" target="_blank">Carithm</a> to explain what you see or hear under the hood.</p>

    <h2>5. Fluid Levels</h2>
    <img src="car3.jpg" alt="Engine Misfire" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin: 10px 0;" />
    <p>Check the oil, transmission fluid, brake fluid, and coolant. Oil should be clean and brown—not black and gritty. Transmission fluid should be pink or red, not brown. Dirty fluids often mean poor maintenance.</p>

    <h2>6. Test Drive the Car</h2>
    <p>Don’t just drive around the block. Test it in real-world conditions—highway speeds, turning, braking, and idling. Listen for odd noises, pay attention to vibrations, and check the alignment. If something feels off, trust your instincts—or use <a href="https://fix-my-car-ai.vercel.app/" target="_blank">Carithm</a> to describe symptoms and get a quick AI diagnosis.</p>

    <h2>7. Check the Electronics</h2>
    <img src="car4.jpg" alt="Engine Misfire" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin: 10px 0;" />
    <p>Test the radio, A/C, heater, windows, locks, lights, and infotainment system. Modern cars are full of electronics, and replacing a broken infotainment screen can cost thousands.</p>

    <h2>8. Scan for OBD-II Codes</h2>
    <p>Even if the check engine light is off, hidden codes may still be stored. Many auto parts stores will scan for free, or you can plug in a Bluetooth scanner and ask <a href="https://fix-my-car-ai.vercel.app/" target="_blank">Carithm</a> what the codes mean. Don’t buy a car with unresolved codes.</p>

    <h2>9. Look at the Exhaust</h2>
    <img src="car5.jpg" alt="Engine Misfire" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin: 10px 0;" />
    <p>Start the car and observe the exhaust. Blue smoke = oil burning. White smoke = coolant in combustion chamber. Black smoke = too much fuel. All of these are red flags.</p>

    <h2>10. Negotiate with Confidence</h2>
    <p>Use what you find as leverage to negotiate. If the tires are worn or the brakes are squeaky, that’s real money off the asking price. And if something feels wrong, don’t be afraid to walk away. There are always other cars.</p>

    <p><strong>Bonus Tip:</strong> Want a second opinion? Try <a href="https://fix-my-car-ai.vercel.app/" target="_blank">Carithm</a>. It’s free and uses AI to analyze car problems based on what you describe.</p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>A used car can serve you well for years if you choose wisely. Take your time, follow this checklist, and don’t skip any steps. When in doubt, get a mechanic’s help—or consult <a href="https://fix-my-car-ai.vercel.app/" target="_blank">Carithm</a> for instant car problem diagnosis.</p>

    <p>Stay safe and shop smart!</p>
